   * - **`fixed`** — screen pixels, whatever size the card renders at. What an
   *   **absent** key means, and so what every plan drawn before this option

   *
   * The split is deliberate and is the whole shape of issue #192. `plan` is
   * the better way to lay a plan out: `fixed` agrees with the drawing only
   * while the card renders at roughly its canvas size, which is not something
   * a plan gets to decide, since the dashboard hands it whatever width it has.
   * Below that the two layers come apart — a plan drawn 980 wide and rendered
   * 510 wide draws every wall at half size while a 14px room name stays 14px,
   * so labels collide with the badges and each other and a carefully spaced
   * cluster of badges overlaps (issue #179).
   *
   * None of which makes it safe to *infer*. 1.5.0 made `plan` the answer for a
   * missing key and resized the overlay of every plan in the field, badges
   * landing at a third of their size on a card narrower than its canvas — and
   * nobody could have opted out, because the editor omitted `fixed` as the
   * default of the day, so a plan that had chosen pixels stored exactly what a
   * plan that had never been asked stored. A new default belongs in new
   * configs: see {@link newPlanConfig} and {@link normalizeOverlayScale}.
   *
   * `fixed` is also a real choice on its own merits, for a card rendered much
   * larger than its canvas or a wall tablet that wants a px floor under its
   * text. See the README's "Where it helps, and where it costs".
