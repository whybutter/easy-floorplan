 * The other elements are not like that: an opening's `toPatch` is one chain of
 * interdependent clears (drop the shutter, and its style, side, invert, badge
 * and second contact go with it), and cutting that into six pieces to gain a
 * heading would be trading a real invariant for a cosmetic one.
 *
 * So grouping them is presentation only. Every group renders the same `data`
 * and the same `toPatch`; only the visible field list differs. `ha-form` reads
 * just the keys in its own schema, and `diffFormValue` diffs against the slice,
 * so a group cannot emit a key it does not show.
 *
 * A field named here that the spec did not produce is skipped — the forms are
 * conditional, and a group asking for "shutterStyle" on an opening with no
 * shutter should render nothing rather than crash. The reverse (a field the

//
// 1. **Identity** — Name, Show name. What the thing *is*, and it is the first
//    question anyone answers.
// 2. **What it reads** — Entity, Attribute, Show state, then the other
//    entities. Show state sits with the entity whose state it shows.
// 3. **Label** — position and size, offered only while a label renders.
// 4. **Badge** — the circle: what it holds, which reading, its glyph and size.
// 5. **Colour** — the active colour and the state rules that supersede it.
// 6. **Effects** — ripple and cast light, each offered only where it means
//    something.
// 7. **Behaviour** — when it is drawn at all, and what a press does.
