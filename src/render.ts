 * How much of an opening's gap a lamp's cast pool passes through — the same
 * question {@link openingClearFraction} answers, except glass admits its
 * whole gap however its sash is sitting, the same rule {@link
 * openingSunFraction} already applies to sunlight and by the same field:
 * {@link openingIsGlazed}. `glazed` means one thing — is this opening glass —
 * and a lamp's light passing through glass same as sunlight does is that one
 * fact read twice, not two different rules that happen to agree.
 *
 * One exception sunlight doesn't need: a **roll-motion** window is a blind,
 * shutter, shade, curtain or awning bound as the opening's own entity (an
 * auto-detected `device_class`, see {@link openingFromDeviceClass}) — a
 * covering standing in for the glass behind it, not the glass itself. Glazed
 * by the same default every window gets, it would read as always-clear no
 * matter how far down it actually is, defeating the one thing binding it was
 * for. So it keeps {@link openingClearFraction}'s answer regardless of
 * `glazed` — the roll-up rule {@link openingClearFraction}'s own docs
 * describe, honoured here too.
 *
 * A shutter — the separate `shutterEntity` layered over an opening — overrides
 * the glass, same priority {@link openingSunFraction} gives it: rolled down,
 * it blocks a lamp's pool same as it blocks the sun, whatever glass sits
 * behind it. `shutter` is `undefined` where none is bound, so an opening
 * without one is judged on itself alone. Unlike the glass rule above, this
 * one is not window-only — any opening with a `shutterEntity` reads it.
 *
 * Every other opening — an ordinary door, an opaque slider, a roll-up —
 * keeps {@link openingClearFraction}'s answer untouched; only real glass,
 * open or shut, is pinned to fully clear.

/**
 * The walls as **light** meets them (issue #143): the plan's walls with a gap
 * cut wherever an opening is currently open.
 *
 * Walls and openings are stored independently — an opening is a rect that sits
 * *on* a wall, and the wall layer only appears cut because {@link renderWallMask}
 * punches the pixels out. {@link glowReach} was handed the uncut segments, so a
 * pool stopped dead at a doorway that the plan draws as a hole. As the reporter
 * put it: doors acted as walls regardless of open/closed status.
 *
 * The rule is that **light agrees with the picture** — it passes exactly where
 * the plan shows a gap. That falls out of using the same `amount` the leaf is
 * drawn from, so a closed door still blocks, a door opening on its sensor lets
 * light through as it swings, and an unbound door — which this card draws open,
 * with its swing arc — lights the room beyond it without anything to configure.
 *
 * A window is the one exception, and it is the caller's rule rather than this
 * function's: a lamp's pool admits light however the sash is sitting, so a
 * caller wanting that reaches for {@link glowClearFraction} instead of {@link
 * openingClearFraction}. This function itself stays agnostic — it just cuts
 * the gap it is handed.
 *
 * The caller supplies how much of each opening is clear — see
 * {@link openingClearFraction} and {@link glowClearFraction}, which is where a
 * two-panel slider's two sensors are reconciled into one number.
 *
 * It may supply **where** instead: a `[start, end]` pair of fractions along
 * the opening places the gap exactly (see {@link openingClearSpan}), which is
 * what a double door with one leaf open needs — the clear half is that leaf's
 * half, not the middle (issue #219). A plain number is still centred, which is
 * what every caller that has no better answer wants.
 *
 * Centring is an approximation worth naming wherever it is still used. A
 * half-open slider really clears the side it slid away from; `converging` is
 * the sharpest case, since its two leaves stack in the centre and what
 * actually clears is a quarter at each jamb — so the gap is the right *size*
 * and the wrong *place*. Those want more than one interval per opening, which
 * this function's one-gap-per-opening shape still cannot say; the amount of
 * light through the wall is right and where it lands is approximate, which a
 * soft radial pool hides most of.

 * on the unmasked build, a lamp's pool read at 45% of its daytime contrast
 * after dark, i.e. exactly `1 - dimOpacity`: lamps became *less* visible at
 * night, the reverse of both physics and expectation.
 *
 * So rather than dimming over the light, the light withholds the dim. Each
 * Cast-light lamp that is on paints a black radial falloff into this mask —
 * black hides the dim — full clearing at the pool's centre, diffusing to full
 * dim at its `glowRadius`. Same centre, same radius, same falloff as
 * {@link renderGlow}, so the clearing and the pool are the same shape by
 * construction.
 *
 * Strength tracks brightness the way the glow does: a full-brightness lamp
 * clears completely, a lamp dimmed to nothing clears about a third.
 *
 * Only Cast-light devices qualify — they are the ones that define a radius.
 * Returns `nothing` when no lamp does, so an ordinary plan pays for no mask.

// renders at roughly its canvas size; at half that, every badge and label is
// twice the size the drawing expects and rooms fill up with colliding text.
//
// `overlayScale: plan` expresses those measures in canvas units instead. The
// plan box becomes a query container and `--fp-u` (declared on the overlay
// inside it, see the card's stylesheet) is one canvas unit as a length, so
// `calc(14 * var(--fp-u))` is 14 canvas units however large the card ends up.

 * and never touching the setting left identical YAML, and both flipped
 * together. Badges came out at a third of their size on a card narrower than
 * its canvas, and the number in the editor no longer matched the drawing
 * (issue #192).

/**
 * A room's outline — drawn as its own pass **above the walls**.

 * An area polygon almost always traces the room it encloses, which means it
 * runs down the centerline of that room's walls. Walls are stroked at
 * {@link WALL_THICKNESS} over the top of the fills, so an outline drawn with
 * the fill lands underneath the very wall it follows and cannot be seen at
 * all. That left `highlight: "border"` (#107) inert on any plan whose areas
 * follow its walls, which is very nearly all of them.
 *
 * Drawn above, the outline colors the room's own walls: an occupied or lit
 * room announces itself along its boundary instead of tinting everything
 * inside it, which is what `highlight: "border"` was for. The caller draws
 * this inside the wall mask, so doorways and windows stay cut out of the
 * outline exactly as they are cut out of the wall.
 *
 * A **live** border is clipped to its own room (`clipId` names the clip path
 * the caller must keep unique). Rooms share walls, and an unclipped stroke
 * straddles the boundary and paints the neighbour's face as well as its own —
 * so on a wall between two live rooms whichever area sits later in `areas:`
 * simply wins the whole wall, and reordering the config silently changes what
 * the plan says. Clipped, each room paints its own side and a corner where
 * several rooms meet splits between them. A **static** `borderColor` is drawn
 * as authored — centered on the polygon, unclipped — since it is decoration
 * placed deliberately rather than a per-room signal.
 *
 * Carries the same `data-id` / `data-entity` hooks as the fill (#111) under its
 * own `fp-area-border` class, so a rule can target a room's outline and its
 * fill separately. They go on the drawn polygon only: a `<clipPath>` is never
 * rendered, so a rule matching one would look like it silently does nothing.
 *
 * Returns `nothing` when there is no outline to draw — the default.
